# MSolve.Stochastic
MSolve library that facilitates Stochastic sampling of input data and statistical response analysis of systems with uncertain parameters.

## Features

- **Stochastic Realizers:** Classes that generate random fields for known marginal probability density function and spectral properties.
  
- **System Realizers:** 
  Classes that assemble separate entities nessecary to define a stochastic system.
  
- **System Evaluators:** Classes that determine the methodology based on which the stochastic system response is being evaluated.

- **Stochastic Domain Mappers:** Calsses that define the mapping from the model geometry domain to the stochastic field domain.
